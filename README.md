# PETs Model

A chatbot for exploring privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in education data projects. It explains options, asks for the facts needed to assess a use case, and helps plan a reviewed pilot. It is decision support, not a legal determination or an expert-approved design.

**Hosting status (November 13, 2026):** The [private Cloud Run chatbot](https://pets-model-850678646784.us-east1.run.app) is live in `mdi-yimingwu-pets`, revision `pets-model-00017-fhd`. Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) requires a Google sign-in. This revision contains the conversation and retrieval improvements described below; its deployment, traffic, IAP setting, and service identity were verified, but a live chat test was not completed after this rollout. Earlier small live tests confirmed the runtime account could call Vertex AI Gemini. The [Sites preview](https://pets-model.fluffy-buddy-4572.chatgpt.site) remains separate and uses the public-source browser fallback. Access for the other named teammates still needs administrator confirmation.

## How the chatbot works

The app uses 52 draft, original summaries linked to public sources. Some have received a [public-source spot check](docs/SOURCE_AUDIT.md); none has a recorded expert approval. It first recognizes simple chat and incomplete use cases, then asks for the purpose and data facts needed to choose PETs. These turns have no citations. For specific PET questions and sufficiently described use cases, it retrieves public guidance and asks Gemini for a cited answer. Follow-up questions preserve the earlier topic; package comparisons use official package documentation, and requests for MDI examples can retrieve detailed public pilot summaries. Relevant [MDI PET resources](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/pets/) get a small priority boost, while specialist legal and technical sources support their respective claims. Prior pilots are examples only when asked for them. The server checks citation IDs, while the “Why this answer” panel identifies draft summaries rather than claiming verbatim quotations. Inspectable rules add PET combinations, caveats, alternatives, and missing facts. If Gemini is unavailable or fails validation, the browser uses the same intake logic or shows a local rule or retrieval answer.

The hosted chatbot uses public PET sources only. Confidential NYSED meeting notes remain local and are neither uploaded nor used by the hosted model.

Legal-permission questions and selected risky releases go to human review. A PET choice does not establish authority to use or disclose data. See [the architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the request flow and limits.

## Share privately on Google Cloud Run

The selected host is [Google Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview). It serves the site and `/api/chat` together. [IAP directly on Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/identity-aware-proxy-cloud-run) requires a Google sign-in and allows named users or a group to open the chatbot in a browser. Cloud Run uses a dedicated [service identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/service-identity) to call the project-scoped Gemini API in Vertex AI. **No Gemini API key needs to be copied into ChatGPT, Codex, GitHub, or Cloud Run.**

The approved project has billing and the required deployment APIs enabled. The runtime account has the narrow `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` permission. IAP is enabled, but this account cannot read or edit its access policy; an administrator must confirm the five named Georgetown users. Connecting [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/kathigg/pets_model) to Cloud Build for deployment from `main` is also pending. The current state and remaining steps are in [Deploy to Google Cloud Run](docs/DEPLOY_GOOGLE_CLOUD_RUN.md).

Cloud Run has a [free allowance](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing), but hosting can incur charges. [Vertex AI model use](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/generative-ai/pricing) is billed separately. The selected model is Gemini 3.5 Flash. The private service has zero minimum instances and a one-instance service cap. The app allows up to 250 model calls per UTC day **per process**; restarts can reset that count. The requested spending target is **$500 per month**. Existing configured monthly spend caps are $450 for Vertex AI and $50 for Cloud Run; the older $500 alerts-only project budget still uses a cumulative period and needs a monthly reset. These controls do not guarantee a hard $500 total monthly cap because other services and billing delays remain. The server logs Gemini token counts without chat content; actual charges must be checked in Cloud Billing.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.13 or newer:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/`. The public-source fallback works without a key. Gemini answers on Cloud Run use its Google service identity, so no API key needs to be placed in this checkout or Codex.

## Privacy boundary

Use hypothetical details. When Gemini answers are active, the browser sends the current message, the earlier topic for a short follow-up, up to four recent conversation turns, and structured case details to the app's server endpoint. The server sends the message and recent context to Vertex AI; PET questions with matching sources also include the earlier topic, case facts, rules, and selected **public** source summaries. Confidential meeting notes are not sent. This app cannot promise that the hosting platform or Google retains no request data. Do not enter protected records, direct identifiers, or material you are not authorized to send to that provider.

The app stores chats and case details in the visitor’s browser storage so they remain after a reload and can be reopened from **Chats**. This is specific to that browser profile, not synced across devices, and someone using the same browser profile can see them. **Clear saved chats** removes that browser copy. The app does not intentionally store server-side transcripts or use analytics; **Download** creates a local Markdown file that the visitor can review before sharing. The public retrieval corpus contains no internal project materials or example datasets. See [the content policy](docs/CONTENT_POLICY.md).

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `public/app.mjs`, `public/styles.css`, `public/assets/` | Chat interface and mascot |
| `cloud-run/`, `Dockerfile` | Google Cloud Run host and service identity |
| `server/`, `public/engine.mjs`, `public/retrieval.mjs` | Review gates, retrieval, PET rules, and Gemini transport |
| `public/data/sources.json` | Draft public-source summaries and provenance |
| `data/eval_queries.json`, `scripts/`, `tests/` | Corpus checks and regression evaluation |
| `app/`, `vite.config.ts`, `build/sites-worker.ts` | Existing Sites preview |

The repository also retains an unused Cloudflare deployment path. Google Cloud Run with IAP is the selected private host. GitHub checks run on each push and pull request without Gemini credentials or model calls; they do not deploy the site.

## Check the project

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

`npm run check` validates corpus metadata and rule citations, runs decision, endpoint, and retrieval tests, and evaluates 17 synthetic retrieval questions. These checks do not establish expert accuracy, legal compliance, privacy protection, or source currency. Expert-labeled cases and privacy, utility, and security reviews are needed before agency use.

Original code and original paraphrased summaries in this repository are MIT licensed. The user-supplied mascot images in `public/assets/` are excluded from that license. External pages remain with their publishers and are linked for attribution. No code or prose was copied from the unlicensed private project archive provided as background.
